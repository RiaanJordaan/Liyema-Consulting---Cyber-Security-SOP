        <h2>What is System Security?</h2>
        <p><img class="page2_image" src="images/pic5.png" alt="Pic5" >
            The security of a computer system is a crucial task. It is a process of ensuring the confidentiality and 
            integrity of the OS.
            <br><br>
            A system is said to be secure if its resources are used and accessed as intended under all circumstances, but 
            no system can guarantee absolute security from several of various malicious threats and unauthorized access.
            <br><br>
            Security violations affecting the system can be categorized as malicious and accidental threats. Malicious 
            threats, as the name suggests are a kind of harmful computer code or web script designed to create system 
            vulnerabilities leading to back doors and security breaches. Accidental Threats, on the other hand, are 
            comparatively easier to be protected against.</p>

            Backup and recovery is the process of duplicating data and storing it in a secure place in case 
            of loss or damage, and then restoring that data to a location — the original one or a safe 
            alternative — so it can be again used in operations. <br> <br> Ideally, this backup copy (often called a 
            snapshot) is immutable — meaning it cannot be altered after it is created to protect against 
            mutations such as ransomware. <br> <br> Backup and recovery is also a category of onsite and cloud-based 
            technology solutions that automate and support this process, enabling organizations to protect 
            and retain their data for business and compliance reasons.</p>

            <br> Payroll Management System Hosted On IronTree's Servers</h3>
            <br><br> <p>The Backup and Recovery solution that is in place, for all Hosted Clients, is done through Cohesity.
            The below is a summarised version of how Cohesity runs in IronTree's environment.
            <br><br>
            • Cohesity performs full system backups with file and folder level restores availabe.
            <br>
            • The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is set for every 4 hours, which is the default RPO for all clients.
            <br><br>
            Below is the Backup Retention Polocy.
            <br><br>
            • Every 4 hours for 1 week.
            <br>
            • Every day for 2 weeks.
            <br>
            • Every week for 1 month.
            <br>
            • Every month for 6 months.
            <br><br>
            You may request a restore at any time should you wish to check and confirm Data Integrity. Irontree is 
            also able to generate Backup Reports when requested or schedule these reports to run daily, weekly or 
            monthly for us to ensure that a successfull restore can be done in the event of a disaster recovery.

            an hourly (24), daily (7), weekly (4) and monthly (12) database backups of the server.
